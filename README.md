# Setting Up for Development

Yank is being officially developed with Android Studio, but it doesn't strictly depend on it. It is
suggested that you set up a blank project, and establish a git repository inside
<Yank Dir>/app/src/main/

This allows the project to exist in a variety of IDEs. You can use something like Eclipse if you
prefer a more "stable" environment, but the yank team has found that Android Studio is quite stable
already.
